### Final Fight Tribute
My name is Sergi Ledesma and I'm currently studying a Master's Degree on Videogame Development. Recently I received an assignment, coding in C++ and SDL a tribute to an old-school arcade Beat 'em up: Final Fight (SNES version). Even though I had not much time during christmas, after a few weeks of work here it is the result.

In this game you'll have to cross the subway platform defeating the enemies aproaching and trying not to die. To play you'll be able to walk (ARROW KEYS), jump (Z) and attack (X). Combining those actions you'll be able to jump up, forward, and attack during those animations performing a flying kick.

Currently there is one type of player character (Cody), one type of enemy (Dug) and one scene, the first one from the second stage (subway platform). The main character and the enemy have movement and attack animations managed with a state machine, a collision module has been implemented to handle combat and trigger boxes and the camera follows the player like in the real game.

You can see the demo here:
